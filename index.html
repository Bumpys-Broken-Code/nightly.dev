      <h3><i>Finally</i></h3>
      <p>
        Software that delivers on the promise of a frictionless developer experience for any <i><u>currently</u></i> existing codebase.

      <h4>How it will work</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>There will be a button to authenticate with all the major version control websites</li>
        <li>You have to click that button</li>
        <li>Once the button has been clicked, you have to authorize all sorts of insane oAuth scopes</li>
        <li>After authorized, you have to click another button.</li>
        <li>That button will only appear after you've authenticated and authorized all the insane oAuth scopes.</li>
        <li>
          Assuming you authorized all the <a href="https://xkcd.com/37/">wild ass</a> scopes, and been redirected back to this page, you click the
          button that says "Give me Peace." There will probably be some religious iconogrphy as well 🙌🙏🧚‍♀️💒🧚‍♂️🙏🙌
        </li>
        <li>You'll have to confirm like at least 10x that you really want to be happy again.</li>
        <li>Once you've made your decision for Christ, we just straight up delete all ur shit. The whole shit. All the repos. Gone.</li>
        <li>🙌🙌🙌</li>
        <li>Go live your life again. We'll keep deleting any code you may push in a moment of weakness.</li>
      </ul>
